# VLRupcomingMatch

Howdy and welcome to my first public github repository. The purpose of this project is to prove to myself that I'm able to write a command line application that parses html and returns useful information. 

As it currently stands, there are known issues with the package management, errors when searching for a player or team that has not had a posted upcoming match, and of course the general sloppyness of this code. Much refactoring to be done.

I'm not a programmer, professional software engineer, or architecht. Please enjoy this node application with a massive grain of salt.
